> Presta is in active development, but still in the early stages. If you've got ideas or suggestions for where it should go, [drop us a line.](https://github.com/sure-thing/presta/issues/new/choose)

## Next up

- server rendering docs for dynamic pages
- Netlify guide
- React guide
- Typescript types - [#5](https://github.com/sure-thing/presta/issues/5)
- page-level renderers for multiple formats in a single projcet - [#11](https://github.com/sure-thing/presta/issues/11)
- server improvements in live-reloading, errors
- static asset utils and configs for easier dev and build workflows

## Future plans

Since Presta is extremely small, it's got room to grow. Future looking features will be built in a way that they can be _layered_ or _composed_, instead of opting into the full feature set for every project like some larger frameworks do.

- serverless function compilation and local server for easy dynamic/hybrid pages
- client-side bundle compilation with easy extension via Webpack
- universal React guide with client-side hydration
