### Hyper minimal framework for the modern web.

> `presta` is in active beta. Questions, comments, ideas? Open an issue or PR!

Render hybrid pages from a server or statically, with convenient co-located data loading. No more prop drilling or fat data files.

Use any JS templating language (yes, React) and bring your own directory structure. Config is easy, if you even need it.

#### Features

- 0kb runtime\*
- Runs ES modules natively in Node with no pre-compilation
- Generate any file format. Seriously. Easily nest microsites.
- Go read the source (and contribute!): atm it's only about 1300 loc.
- Get started in seconds, right from the command line. Scale to thousands of pages.
- There's no magic, only strings. Bring back the document web.

\*There is no runtime. Pulled a sneaky on ya.

#### Installation

`presta` needs to be installed locally to your project:

```bash
$ npm i presta
```

Don't forget, you can always ask the CLI for help:

```bash
$ npx presta -h
```
